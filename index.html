                    <h2>Einhell GH-EC 2040 Electric Chainsaw -- 2000W, 16 Inch (40cm) OREGON Bar and Chain, Saw Kickback Protection, Tool-Free Tensioning</h2>
                </header>
                <p>
                    A quality rail and chain from Oregon ensure optimum cutting performance.

The kickback protection facility with an instant mechanical chain brake will stop the chain immediately if the GH-EC 2040 rears up suddenly.

A large window makes it easy to check how much oil is in the oil tank of the automatic chain lubrication system.

                    <h2>The Mezzanine (Granta Editions) Paperback by Nicholson Baker</h2>
                </header>
                <p>
                    The Mezzanine is the story of one man's lunch hour. Pondering life's littlest questions - why does one shoelace always wear out before the other? Whatever happened to the paper drinking straw - our narrator interrogates the inner-workings of corporate living as he traipses his way down escalators to the first floor and through the mundaneness of office life.

Mixing humour with the existentialism that surrounds all our working lives, The Mezzanine is a classic work of modern American literature.

                    A must see movie
This is a great movie. Robins is great in this a heart rendering tale of prison life.
An all star cast featuing Morgan Freeman . From the short story Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank redemption written by Stephen King in a short story collection called DifferentSeasons, although it can now be bought on it's own.
This is is an absolutely great 90's film and I would recommend to any body who likes a good story of friendship and hard ship in a movie .
